Introduction

The Piscine Reloaded is a best-of of the exercises you did during the Piscine C to
remind you all the basics of the C programming language. All the exercises has to be
done entierly to unlock the next project.
If you have already done some of these exercises during the Piscine C, we highly
recommend not be tempted to retrieve your old code. The learning of programming
involves practice and making an existing code has no interest.

General rules

• Only this page will serve as reference; do not trust rumors.
• Make sure you have the appropriate permissions on your files and directories.
• You have to follow the turn-in procedures for every exercise.
• Your exercises will be checked and graded by a program called Moulinette.
• Moulinette is very meticulous and strict in its evaluation of your work. It is entirely
automated and there is no way to negotiate with it. So if you want to avoid bad
surprises, be as thorough as possible.
• Exercises in Shell must be executable with /bin/sh.
• You cannot leave any additional file in your directory than those specified in the
subject.
• Got a question? Ask your peer on the right. Otherwise, try your peer on the left.
• Your reference guide is called Google / man / the Internet / ....
• Check out the forum on the intranet and Slack.
• Examine the examples thoroughly. They could very well call for details that are
not explicitly mentioned in the subject...
• Moulinette is not very open-minded. It won’t try and understand your code if it
doesn’t respect the Norm. Moulinette relies on a program called Norminator to
check if your files respect the norm. TL;DR: it would be idiotic to submit a piece
of work that doesn’t pass Norminator’s check.
• Using a forbidden function is considered cheating. Cheaters get -42, and this grade
is non-negotiable.
• You’ll only have to submit a main() function if we ask for a program.

Piscine Reloaded It’s good to be back
• Moulinette compiles with these flags: -Wall -Wextra -Werror, and uses gcc.
• If ft_putchar() is an authorized function, we will compile your code with our
ft_putchar.c.
• If your program doesn’t compile, you’ll get 0.
• By Odin, by Thor! Use your brain!!!
